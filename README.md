# ChooseMyBeer

## find the beer that's right for you
ChooseMyBeer is intended to calculate the [BevMo beer kegs](http://www.bevmo.com/Shop/ProductList.aspx/Beer/Kegs/_/N-15Z1z141vn?DNID=Beer) with the highest alcohol volume per USD. This is done by cross referencing the kegs with beers and alcohol percentages listed on [Realbeer.com](http://www.realbeer.com/edu/health/calories.php). The user is given a menu to choose from the top three kegs accompanied with their volume in gallons, price, availability, and descriptions. Choosing a keg will open the relevant BevMo page in your browser.

## To do
* Add both ways keyword matching (in and not in) for filtering kegs based on description
* Improve the matching algorithm for more accurate pairings, rather than choosing the first that meets the specs
