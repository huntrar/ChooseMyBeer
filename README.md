# ChooseMyBeer

## find the beer that's right for you
ChooseMyBeer is intended to calculate beer kegs with the highest alcohol volume per dollar. This is done by cross referencing the alcohol content of the available beers online and then computing the best ratio of price to alcohol content. This only works for [BevMo! beer kegs](http://www.bevmo.com/Shop/ProductList.aspx/Beer/Kegs/_/N-15Z1z141vn?DNID=Beer) and uses [Realbeer.com](http://www.realbeer.com/edu/health/calories.php) for alcohol percentage facts. By default a menu appears with the top three options displayed to choose from, accompanied with their information. Choosing a keg directly opens the link to the page for purchase.
