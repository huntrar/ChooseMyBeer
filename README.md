# ChooseMyBeer

## find the beer that's right for you
ChooseMyBeer is intended to calculate the best beer per alcohol content. This is done by cross referencing the alcohol content of the available beers online and then computing the best ratio of price to alcohol content. This only works for [BevMo! kegs](http://www.bevmo.com/Shop/ProductList.aspx/Beer/Kegs/_/N-15Z1z141vn?DNID=Beer) and uses [Realbeer.com](http://www.realbeer.com/edu/health/calories.php) for alcohol percentage facts.
